## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6.3 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- PostgreSQL (if not using Docker)

### Local Development Setup (Without Docker)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AirportReservationSystem.git
   cd AirportReservationSystem
   ```

2. **Configure the database**
   - Install PostgreSQL if not already installed
   - Create a new database named `airport_db`
   - Update `application.properties` with your database credentials:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/airport_db
     spring.datasource.username=your_username
     spring.datasource.password=your_password
     ```

3. **Build and run the application**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
   - H2 Console (if enabled): http://localhost:8080/h2-console

### Docker Setup (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository** (if not already done)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramazansakin/AirportReservationSystem.git
   cd AirportReservationSystem
   ```

2. **Build and start the containers**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   This will:
   - Build the Spring Boot application
   - Start a PostgreSQL container
   - Initialize the database with sample data

3. **Access the application**
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
   - Application: http://localhost:8080
